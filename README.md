  <p align="center">
State-of-the-art rock lithology identification is based on manual inspection and laboratory microscopic testing. This approach is time-consuming, expensive, uncertain, and subject to human bias. Furthermore, people always wonder about rock types during outdoor activities, so a rock classification tool would find many industrial and educational applications. Prior attempts to automate this process used various techniques without success. Yet, deep learning has not been considered, and thus this novel project explores this application. There is not an open-source dataset curated for this problem. Hence, we scraped the web and designed a dataset from scratch for igneous rock classification with 7 classes: Andesite, Basalt, Diorite, Gabbro, Granite, Peridotite, and Rhyolite. State-of-the-art pretrained computer vision architectures are explored, including VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet. Fully unfrozen, pretrained DenseNet121 showed the best performance on the validation set with average precision, recall, and F_1  score of 91.07%, 92.73%, and 91.17%, respectively. Error analysis and rock features are explored by generating Grad-CAM heatmaps to understand how the model arrives at class predictions. It is observed that granularity and color are major contributors to the classification process.
